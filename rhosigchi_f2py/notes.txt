Notes from JEM 20190206: This folder contains the rhosigchi.f code from the oslo-method-software, hacked by me to be compilable as a Python submodule using f2py. 

I have since given up on it, because it turned out to be tricky to ensure that the calibrations were correct, etcetera. But I think I will let them stay here for now, and then we can choose to delete them later. Maybe they will turn out to be useful. The way the chisquare minimization is implemented is very different from the approach taken in the fit_rho_T() function currently included in the oslo_method_python module. While the latter uses an off-the-shelf minimizer, rhosigchi.f solves a custom set of equations, derived in the Schiller et. al. NIM paper.
