This is oslo_method_python, a python implementation of the Oslo method.
It handles two-dimensional matrices of event count spectra, and
implements detector response unfolding, first generation method
and other manipulation of the spectra.

It is heavily inspired by MAMA, written by Magne Guttormsen and others,
